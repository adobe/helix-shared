/**
 * Generic library for functional programming and advanced utilization
 * of es6 iterators.
 *
 * map, fold and so on...
 *
 * sequence.js functions are fully lazy and work with anything implementing
 * the iterator protocol; in addition, all functions also support treating
 * plain objects as sequences!
 *
 * The advantage of lazy implementations is that these functions work efficiently
 * with very long or even infinite sequences; assuming the following example is
 * given a sequence with ten billion elements, it would still start printing it's
 * output immediately and would not require creating another billion element array
 * as `Array.map` would do.
 * In practice the `x*2` would be calculated immediately before the result is printed.
 *
 * ```
 * each(map(sequence, (x) => x*2), console.log)
 * ```
 *
 * A disadvantage of lazyness is that side effects (e.g. a console.log inside a map())
 * are not executed, before the resulting sequence is actually being consumed by a
 * for loop or each() or fold() or similar functionsâ€¦
 * So if you need to perform side effects, remember to use one of these
 * instead of lazy functions like map();
 *
 * sequence.js functions also support passing functions as the last argument:
 *
 * ```
 * each(seq, (elm) => {
 *   doSomething(elm);
 *   console.log(elm);
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * is much more readable then the example below; especially when you
 * are using multiple nested each/map/fold calls and the function bodies
 * grow long!
 *
 * ```
 * each((elm) => {
 *   doSomething(elm);
 *   console.log(elm);
 * }, seq);
 * ```
 *
 * Some of the utilities in here can *mostly* be implemented with
 * standard js6.
 * The emphasis here is on mostly, since sequence.js functions are
 * designed to have fewer edge cases that classical es6 pendants and
 * therefor make for a smoother coding experience.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * # Iteration
 *
 * ```
 * > for (const v of {foo: 42, bar: 23}) console.log(v);
 * TypeError: {(intermediate value)(intermediate value)} is not iterable
 * ```
 *
 * Does not work because plain objects do not implement the iterator protocol.
 *
 * # Replace With
 *
 * ```
 * > each([1,2,3,4], console.log);
 * 1
 * 2
 * 3
 * 4
 * ```
 *
 * or
 *
 * ```
 * > each({foo: 42}, v => console.log(v));
 * [ 'foo', 42 ]
 * ```
 *
 * or the following if the full power of a for loop is really required..
 *
 * ```
 * for (const v of iter({foo: 42})) console.log(v);
 *[ 'foo', 42 ]
 * ```
 *
 * # Array.forEach
 *
 * ````
 * > [1,2,3,4].forEach(console.log)
 * 1 0 [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
 * 2 1 [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
 * 3 2 [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
 * 4 3 [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
 * ```
 *
 * Unexpectedly yields a lot of output; that is because forEach also passes
 * the index in the array as well as the `thisArgument`.
 * This behaviour is often unexpected and forces us to define an intermediate
 * function.
 *
 * ## Replace With
 *
 * ```
 * > each([1,2,3,4], console.log);
 * 1
 * 2
 * 3
 * 4
 * ```
 *
 * If the index is really needed, `enumerate()` may be used:
 *
 * ```
 * each(enumerate([42, 23]), console.log)
 * [ 0, 42 ]
 * [ 1, 23 ]
 * ```
 *
 * As a sidenote this also effortlessly fits the concept of a key/value
 * container; the output of `enumerate([42, 23])` could easily passed
 * into `new Map(...)`;
 *
 * The full behaviour of for each
