Representation of a origin host for a proxy strain.

As proxy strains deliver content from another web server, the `origin` property can be used to specify the source of this third-party content to be served. In the simplest case, the `origin` property can be a simple URL, but for advanced configuration, all the properties in this schema are available.

The properties in this schema are largely identical with the properties defined in the [Fastly Backend API](https://docs.fastly.com/api/config#backend).
