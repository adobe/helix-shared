Defines a mapping between mount points and source URLs. Mount points **must** start with a slash (`/`) but may not end with one.

This configuration can typically be found in the `helix-fstab.yaml` file.

The name and format are inspired by the [UNIX file system table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fstab).
