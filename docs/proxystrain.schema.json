The `origin` property can be either the base URL of the web server that you want to serve content from\nor a more complex configuration object, described in the [Origin schema](origin.schema.md).\n\nMost of the other properties that can be used to describe other strains (i.e. [Runtime strains](runtimestrain.schema.md)) do not work for Proxy strains and are not just irrelevant, but also forbidden.\n\n## What are useful scenarios for Proxy Strains?\n\nYou can use Proxy Strains in a number of scenarios:\n\n- in order to integrate non-Helix web applications that should run on the same hostname\n- in order to serve legacy content from an old website as a fallback\n- in order to enable a gradual migration of an existing site to Helix\n\nA good pattern for migrating to Project Helix is to define one proxy strain as the `default` that serves the old site from the current backend.\n\nOver time, add more and more runtime strains that are powered by Helix and adjust the `url` and `conditions` so that they receive more traffic.","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"name":{"type":"string","description":"Name of the strain"},"origin":{"description":"Origin backend for proxy strains.","anyOf":[{"type":"string","format":"uri"},{"$ref":"https://ns.adobe.com/helix/shared/origin"}]},"sticky":{"description":"Sticky strains are not re-evaluated on every request.
